\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my final project I\'92d like to create a personal website to serve as an online gallery for my pottery and knitting projects. A banner will rotate between featured images, and I\'92ll have sections to view all pottery or view all knitting, including descriptions (or maybe instructions/patterns) where applicable.}
